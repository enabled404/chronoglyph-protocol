# Contributing to ChronoGlyph Protocol

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the ChronoGlyph Protocol! Your involvement is crucial for its growth and refinement. This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, including:

* **Improving the Protocol:** Suggesting new symbols, refining existing definitions, or enhancing the grammatical structure.
* **Encoding Documents:** Applying the ChronoGlyph Protocol to encode new historical or philosophical texts.
* **Developing Tools:** Creating parsers, validators, visualizers, or other software to work with ChronoGlyph encodings.
* **Writing Documentation:** Improving the `SYMBOL_LEGEND.md`, tutorials, or other explanatory materials.
* **Reporting Bugs or Issues:** Identifying errors in the protocol definition, example encodings, or tools.
* **Suggesting Enhancements:** Proposing new features or improvements.

## Getting Started

1.  **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2.  **Clone your fork** locally: `git clone https://github.com/enabled404/chronoglyph-protocol.git`
3.  **Create a new branch** for your changes: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name` or `fix/issue-description`.

## Making Changes

* **Symbol Legend (`SYMBOL_LEGEND.md`):**
    * If proposing changes to symbols or syntax, clearly explain the rationale.
    * Ensure consistency with the existing protocol structure.
    * Provide examples of how the new/modified symbol would be used.
* **Example Encodings (`/examples`):**
    * Ensure your encoding strictly adheres to the `SYMBOL_LEGEND.md`.
    * Comment your encodings where necessary for clarity, especially for complex interpretations.
    * New example documents should be significant and demonstrate the protocol's capabilities.
* **Code (for tools):**
    * Follow any established coding style (to be defined if/when tools are developed).
    * Include tests for new features or bug fixes.

## Submitting Contributions

1.  **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive commit messages.
    * Example: `feat: Add §causal_chain operator for multi-step causality`
    * Example: `fix: Corrected symbol usage in DoI grievances section`
    * Example: `docs: Clarified definition of Ε:concept in SYMBOL_LEGEND`
2.  **Push your changes** to your fork on GitHub: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`.
3.  **Open a Pull Request (PR)** to the `main` branch of the `enabled404/chronoglyph-protocol` repository.
    * Provide a clear title and description for your PR, explaining the changes and their purpose.
    * Reference any relevant issues (e.g., "Closes #123").

## Code of Conduct

While this project is young, we expect all contributors to adhere to common standards of respectful and constructive communication. Consider adopting a formal Code of Conduct (e.g., the Contributor Covenant) as the community grows. For now, please:
* Be respectful of differing views and experiences.
* Give and accept constructive feedback gracefully.
* Focus on the technical merits of proposals and discussions.

## Questions?

Feel free to open an issue if you have questions about the protocol, how to contribute, or specific changes you'd like to propose.
